Gravity is a long-range force that acts between two objects, with the magnitude of the force decreasing with the square of the distance between them. The gravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Gravity plays a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, from the formation of galaxies and stars to the motion of planets and other celestial bodies.
